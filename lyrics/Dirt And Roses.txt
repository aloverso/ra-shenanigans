"Dirt And Roses"
This city grieves like widows clasping folded flags against their hearts
Raindrops spill like dirt and roses on black coffins in the dark
Not yet corpses, still we rot, oblivious to our decay
Drinking poison, drop by drop, descend to dark
Unless we save our lives
From the coming tide
That seeks to drown us in its waves
But if we sell our soul
For the chance of gold
Then we'll rue each passing day
And I swear this place once was alive
The streets all pulsed like living veins 
Heart was beating cars with blood
The buildings breathe each time they sway
Time of death
Punctuated by the bells
The sky turned red
Then came the rain
Come on let's save our lives
From the coming tide
That seeks to drown us in its waves
But if we sell our soul
For the chance of gold
Then we'll rue each passing day.
They drown, they'll crush you from the top
I'd rather die,
I would rather chase them down
These worlds are crashing forward,
They try to set alight
Build our true fates while they drown
Like fallen soldiers on these fields
We spared our lives
Bodies holed up on the wheels
I swear we tried
I gave up on this godforsaken sight,
And felt it all pass by.
Come on let's save our lives
From the coming tide
That seeks to drown us in its waves
But if we sell our soul
for the chance of gold
then we'll rue each passing day.
So save our
(Save our lives)
Our lives,
it's coming clear,
Yeah it's been coming clear 
(Coming clear)
To me...
We'll never sell our soul
For the chance of gold
And we'll live each passing day
