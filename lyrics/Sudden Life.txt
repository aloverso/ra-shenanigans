"Sudden Life"
Floating in the clouds, I'm giving up the fight
A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light
We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sound
I saw it flicker like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Flipping channels in a world gone static
Eroding away line by the fading line
Under water for years we found, till we started to swim than drown
The current takes us, now we're walking into the light
Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat and tired out (Walking into the light)
You want to live but don't know how (Walking into the light)
Diagnosis: sudden life (Walking into the light)
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light
Woke up floating on a wave of golden sound
Tunnel vision and a great beyond
Heart beating like a rhythm slowing down
And it's gone, an echo of a song
Flat line and a closing bell
Whisper a warm farewell
The flames are beckoning
As we're walking into the light
Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat and tired out (Walking into the light)
You want to love but don't know how (Walking into the light)
Diagnosis: sudden life (Walking into the light)
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light
Don't suppose that you know the way?
Don't suppose that you care?
I see lights up ahead and hear choirs of angels ring in my ears
But you know that, had you a choice, you would go back and do it again
We all have unfinished business to tend
So no I won't go gentle
Into the good night
You can keep your candle
I'm walking away from the light
Yeah I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
Diagnosis: sudden life (Walking away from the light)
(Walking away from the light)
I woke up my heart racing, I'm (Walking away from the light)
At a loss explaining why (Walking away from the light)
Are you dying all your life? (Walking away from the light)
(Walking away from the lightt)
Then put your darkest days behind
Let life flash right before your eyes (Walking away from the light)
And for very the first time,
It feels like I'm walking away from the light
