"Lanterns"
This night will fall like any other
Daylight subsides and shadows crawl
Out from under black corners
Hiding something
Stirs, all so restless
Cracked windows open wide
Dead-bolt turns doors creak open
With stars and moonlight there to guide
Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night?
We'll dance like heathens round a flame
While the world sleeps we are awake
The black brook calls
It sings a chorus
While the gathering swells
The flames grow tall
Right before us
As drums keep pounding
And the masses now are fusing
Bodies pressed and tangled
As we revel in confusion
Our inhibitions thrown into the fire
Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night?
We'll dance like heathens round a flame
While the world sleeps we are awake
Here in the dark we are safe from the judgement
Now arm in arm locked tight so no one gets in
The heaven-sent say, "Child, you are hell-bent."
But hell is not where we're going
Hell's where we've been
Come raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens round the flame
And while the world sleeps we are awake
Raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flames
And while the world sleeps we are awake
We are awake
(raise your lantern to the sky)
We are awake
We are awake
(now raise your lantern to the sky)
We are awake
Yeah we are awake
