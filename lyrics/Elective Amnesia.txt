"Elective Amnesia"
We don't sleep very much
These triggers ache for the touch
Where's the strength we relied on?
Fear alone, like a crutch,
Maybe that's what keeps us up
All night with the light on
All these screams emulate
Lives that no longer take place
Can this be what we've become?
Paper thin, overweight,
Pills to arouse or sedate
Still we don't know what we want
We can't let go
Can't you see?
To lose control
Is to be...
Finally free!
First a spark
Then a flame
Now a fire
We explode
Into the darkest of nights
Disconnect
Cut the cord
Lines are dead
Now they'll know
With everything comes a price
And each day we are torn
Between the right and the wrong
Between life and convenience
Why do we sleep? Why complain?
There's always channels to change
It's like elective amnesia
As we grow older in this place
Let's just start over
Let's erase
What they've made!
First a spark
Then a flame
Now a fire
We explode
Into the darkest of nights
Disconnect
Cut the cord
Lines are dead
Now they'll know
With everything comes a price
It could be minutes away
It could be hours or days
Before the bottom falls out
Before the ground gives way
Into this debt we are born
A debt we try to repay
And yet we blacken the sky
Smoke rising out of the flames
Now they'll know...
First a spark
Then a flame
Now a fire
We explode
Into the darkest of nights
Disconnect
Cut the cord
Lines are dead
Now they'll know
With everything comes a price
(First a spark)
(Then a flame)
(Now a fire)
We explode
We explode
With everything comes a prince
(disconnect)
(cut the cord)
(lines are dead)
We explode
We explode
