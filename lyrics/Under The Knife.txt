"Under The Knife"
Wake me up inside
Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off my knees and,
Follow this path of most resistance.
And where ever it takes us,
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads,
So wake me when it's through,
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside
Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Although we looked awake, inside we're all still sleeping
And I spent my time here alive, but barely there 
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?
So wake me when it's through,
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them,
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in.
Don't show me anything!
Just wake me when it's through,
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside
