"Any Way You Want It" (originally by Journey) 
Anyway you want it  
That's the way you need it 
Anyway you want it 
She loves to dance 
She loves to sing 
She does everything 
She loves to move 
She loves to groove 
She loves the lovin' things 
All night  
All night  
Oh every night 
So hold tight 
Hold tight 
Oh baby hold tight 
She said 
Anyway you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Anyway you want it 
Anyway you want it 
That's the way you need it  
Anyway you want it 
I was alone  
I never knew 
What good love could do 
Then we touched 
And we sang 
About the lovin' things 
All night 
All night 
Oh every night 
So hold tight 
Hold tight 
Oh baby hold tight 
She said 
Anyway you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Anyway you want it 
Anyway you want it 
That's the way you need it  
Anyway you want it
