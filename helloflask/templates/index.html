    <h2>Enter a search term</h2>

    <form action="." method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="text">
        <input type="submit" name="my-form" value="Send"> 
        <input type="checkbox" name="exact_flag">Exact matches only
    </form>
     <div style="max-width:500px; word-wrap:break-word;"><font size="2"><p>This app will search through all Rise Against songs (including covers) and display snippets of each song where a lyric matches the search term.  Selecting "Exact matches only" will restrict the search to only the word(s) searched.  Otherwise, it will display all lines that <i>contain</i> the search term.  For example, by default it will include songs that contain the word "burning" when searching for "burn", and selecting "Exact matches only" will prevent this.</p></font></div>
