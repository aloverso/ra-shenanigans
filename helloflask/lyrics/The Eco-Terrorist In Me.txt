"The Eco-Terrorist In Me"
Spray paint the cameras, jam the frequency,
What you kill, just comes alive in me,
Hoods and bandanas make not an enemy,
You can't define us, any way you please!
You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my sins absolved
Because I found God (hey!)
In the sound of your factories burning down,
Now I sleep so sound...
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let it go?
Instead of doing what's right, they built higher walls
Where we can't shed a light on true criminals
When business and suffering is one and the same
When laws fail the people they turn to the flame
I found love (love!)
I found life (life!)
As a thorn stuck in your side,
And you wonder why...
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on? (Will you hold on?)
Did you hold on or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down,
When it all comes down...
When the lights all blow out, and roadblocks blow up,
When you sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
