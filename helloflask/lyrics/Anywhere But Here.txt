"Anywhere But Here" 
We've been alright up until now, 
But the air that we breathe is about to run out. 
We've rehearsed our lines clear and loud, 
But the cue never came and the lights, 
They never went down. 
So we're passing the time,  
While time passes us. 
The fast lanes a term never applied to us. 
Without a dime to my name, 
Or a prayer in the world. 
I walk out the door. 
Destination anywhere but here. 
Away from you. 
Now I'm on my way to the other side, 
(On my way) 
I'll forget everything I left behind. 
(On my way) 
These empty rooms, 
(On my way) 
Are still filled with you. 
(On my way) 
So I dropped out of my own race, 
A race with no finish line, 
No first or last place. 
These faces all rush right past me. 
I turn and walk away, 
Cause we finally know now what our 
Time here's about, we were not meant to be 
Another face in the crowd. 
We're a forest of lives, 
But we grow tall and wide.  
We'll never be cut down. 
Destination anywhere but here. 
Away from you. 
Now I'm on my way to the other side, 
(On my way) 
I'll forget everything I left behind. 
(On my way) 
These empty rooms, 
(On my way) 
Are still filled with you. 
(On my way) 
I'm so tired and turned around and scared. 
I'm lying in empty beds again. 
I'll wait for you to come 
To your senses, barbed-wire fences 
Won't keep me from breaking through. 
I swear I will to you. 
Now I'm on my way to the other side, 
(On my way) 
I'll forget everything I left behind. 
(On my way) 
These empty rooms, 
(On my way) 
Are still filled with you. 
(On my way) 
I'm so tired and turned around and scared. 
I'm lying in empty beds again. 
Away from you.
