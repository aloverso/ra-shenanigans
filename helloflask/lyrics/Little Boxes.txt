"Little Boxes" (originally by Malvina Reynolds)
Little boxes on the hillside,
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky,
Little boxes on the hillside,
Little boxes, all the same.
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
They're all made out of ticky-tacky,
And they all look just the same.
And the people in houses
who went to the university,
where they were put in boxes,
And they all came out the same.
There's doctors and lawyers
And business executives,
They're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same.
And they all play on the golf-course,
And drink their Martini dry,
And they all have pretty children,
And the children go to school.
And the children go to summer camp
And then to the university,
They all get put in boxes
And they all come out the same.
And the boys go into business,
And marry, raise a family,
And they all get put in boxes,
Little boxes, all the same.
Yeah a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same.
