"Blood To Bleed"
This place rings with echoes of
Lives once lived but now are lost
Time spent wondering about tomorrow
I don't care if we lose it all tonight
Up in flames, burning bright
Warming the air of the world
"I don't love you anymore" is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed
'Cause my heart has been draining into the sea
Steps, I take in your footsteps
Aren't getting me closer to what is left
Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know
Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?
"I don't love you anymore" is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed
'Cause my heart has been draining into the sea
Still I wait
With a hope inside of me (inside of me)
So still (so still) I wait (I wait)
Until again we meet
Until again we meet
Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?
"I don't love you anymore" is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed
'Cause my heart has been draining into the sea
Still I wait
With a hope (so still) inside of me (I wait)
So still (a hope) I wait (inside of me)
