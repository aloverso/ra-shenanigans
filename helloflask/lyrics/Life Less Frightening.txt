"Life Less Frightening"
Suffering from something
We're not sure of
In a world 
There is no cure for
These lives we live
Test negative for happiness
Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open
Single file like soldiers on a mission
If there's no war outside our heads
Why are we losing?
I don't ask for much (Life less)
Truth be told I'd settle (frightening)
For a life less frightening, (Life less)
A life less frightening (frightening)
Hang me out to dry
I'm soaking
With the sins of knowing
What's gone wrong 
But doing nothing
I still run
Time again I have found myself stuttering
Foundations pulled out from under me
This breath is wasted on them all
Will someone answer me
Is there a God tonight
Up in the sky
Or is it empty just like me? (Just like me)
A place where we can hide
Out from the night
Where you are all I see (Where you are all I see)
So blow a kiss goodbye then close your eyes
Tell me what you see (Tell me what you see)
A lifetime spent inside this dream of mine
Where you are all I see
